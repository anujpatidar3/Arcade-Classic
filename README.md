# Arcade-Classic
A classic Arcade game

The rules of the game are as follows:
1. If you miss the ball, it will bounce from centre.
2. If a person score 7 points against computer, he/she wins.

A html-css file is added for the styling of ball which is avoided in the game for the sake of simplicity.
Though You can implement it along with the game if u want to improve it's styling.
